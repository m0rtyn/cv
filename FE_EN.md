> 👋 Hello! I am a Senior Frontend Developer with 8 years of experience.
>
> I develop with React and TypeScript. I have worked on projects using Vue and Angular 2+. Automation with Node.js and Python is in my skillset. I pay attention to code architecture, maintainability, and complexity.
>
> I am able to create design systems in collaboration with designers. I educate frontend developers and improve communication processes. I provide detailed code reviews with explanations, avoiding accusations and harmful criticism.
>
> Teamwork is important to me: I am experienced in agile methodologies and can plan in uncertainty. I conduct task grooming and retrospectives, avoiding wasted collective time. I easily build trustful relationships with colleagues.
